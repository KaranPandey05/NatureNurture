## The Problem

The agricultural sector faces significant challenges due to the rapid spread of plant diseases, which can severely reduce crop yields and impact global food security. Farmers and gardeners, particularly in rural or less-developed areas, often lack access to advanced education or tools that could help them recognize early signs of plant infections. This delay in diagnosis allows infections to spread unchecked, leading to destructive outbreaks that could otherwise be prevented. Furthermore, misidentifying diseases or using incorrect treatment methods can exacerbate the problem. Current methods for identifying plant diseases rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often not readily available.

## Proposed Solution

This AI-driven program aims to bridge the educational gap by providing an accessible, easy-to-use tool that can detect and classify plant infections with high accuracy. Using a dataset of plant images representing 38 different categories of infections, the model analyzes a photo of a diseased plant leaf and identifies the type of infection, empowering users to take prompt action.

### Key Features:
1. **Image-Based Detection**: The user uploads a photo of a potentially infected plant, and the AI model analyzes the image to identify the infection.
   
2. **38-Class Classification**: The AI can distinguish between 38 different types of plant infections, ensuring accurate diagnosis and treatment suggestions.

3. **Preventing the Spread**: By identifying infections early, the tool helps prevent plant disease outbreaks, minimizing damage to crops.

4. **Educational Insights**: After identifying the disease, the tool provides information on symptoms, treatment options, and preventive measures, educating users and increasing their ability to manage future infections.

5. **Scalability and Accessibility**: The program is designed to be accessible via mobile devices, making it a practical tool for use directly in the field. It offers a low-cost, scalable solution that can be adopted by farmers, hobbyists, and agricultural communities around the world.

## Usage

1. Upload a clear image of the infected plant leaf.
2. The AI will classify the infection into one of 38 categories.
3. Review the diagnosis and ask the chatbot for more information.
